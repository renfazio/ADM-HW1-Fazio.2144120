First ADM Homework (PROBLEM 1 + PROBLEM 2 + PROBLEM 3).

For PROBLEM 1 and PROBLEM 2: The first file is made up of all the exercise codes (the exercises from PROBLEM 1 and the challenges from PROBLEM 2), put together in a single script, and it is called 'Fazio 2144120 Submission.py'.

I also uploaded a PDF file containing the screenshots of the submission page of HackerRank. The file is called "Fazio 2144120 Submission.pdf".

For PROBLEM 3 I uploaded a PDF file called "Fazio 2144120 AWS.pdf" containing the screesnhots attesting to completion of the AWS forms.
